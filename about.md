<p>I am a <span class="bright">Data Scientist</span> by profession & passion, currently heading Project Engineering in InnovAccer Inc., where I handle designing algorithms, models and APIs for platforms and products. I lead a team of software engineers, product developers, researching into latest data science techniques in order to align the solutions towards best in class technologies. I have had the opportunity to apply data science frameworks across multiple verticals including HealthCare, Mutual Funds.</p>

<p>I have worked with supervised learning methods such as generalized regression models, decision trees, ensemble models (bagging algorithms, random forest, xgboost), support vector machines (SVM) and unsupervised models such as k-means clustering, gaussian mixture models, PCA and self-organizing maps. I have strong basics in linear algebra, information theory and statistics. Currently I am enhancing my knowledge of deep belief networks, autoencoders, convolutional neural networks and tensorflow.</p>
						
<p>I have recently started my journey with Kaggle to accquire top notch skills in data science<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nareshbab" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>.
